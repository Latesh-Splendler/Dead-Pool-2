        <h1>About Deadpool</h1>
        <p>
          Deadpool is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.  
          Created by Fabian Nicieza and Rob Liefeld, the character first appeared in New Mutants #98 (December 1990). 
          In his comic book appearances, Deadpool is initially depicted as a supervillain of the New Mutants and X-Force, though later stories would portray him as an antihero. 
          Deadpool is the alter ego of Wade Wilson, a disfigured Canadian mercenary with superhuman regenerative healing abilities. 
          He is known for his tendency to joke incessantly and break the fourth wall for humorous effect.

          The character's popularity has seen him featured in numerous other media outlets. 
          In the 2004 series Cable & Deadpool, he refers to his own scarred appearance as "Ryan Renolds [sic] crossed with a Shar Pei".[6][7] 
          Reynolds himself developed an interest in portraying the character when reading this comic,[8] which was ultimately realized in the X-Men film series, 
          including X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009), Deadpool (2016), and its sequels Deadpool 2 (2018) and Deadpool & Wolverine (2024),[9][10][11][12] the latter in which Blake Lively, Matthew McConaughey, 
          Paul Mullin, Nathan Fillion, Peggy, Inez Reynolds, and Olin Reynolds also portray alternate versions of Deadpool from the multiverse.
